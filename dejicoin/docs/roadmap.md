# Dejicoin Roadmap

A transparent, irreversible path of decentralization — from the first block.

---

## ✅ Phase 1 — Complete Decentralization (Q4 2025)

- Launch **Dejicoin (DEJI)** on **Binance Smart Chain Mainnet**  
- Ownership **renounced at deployment** — no admin, no privileged keys  
- **Liquidity permanently locked** to ensure zero control  
- Deploy **TimelockController** and **DejiGovernor** simultaneously  
- Governor granted proposer role, Timelock as executor — full on-chain governance  
- Publish **Dejicoin Whitepaper v1.0** and open documentation repo  

> ✔️ Result: Dejicoin becomes fully decentralized and community-owned from the very first transaction.

## 🚀 Phase 2 — Community Governance Growth (Q1 2026)

- Activate proposal and voting through **DejiGovernor**  
- Launch **community dashboard** for transparent governance tracking  
- First community proposals: marketing, utility ideas, and small ecosystem grants  
- On-chain verification of governance votes (no backend servers)

---

## 🌐 Phase 3 — Ecosystem Expansion (Q2 2026)

- Listing on decentralized exchanges (DEX integration)  
- Release of **Dejicoin DAO Portal** for proposal creation and discussion  
- Community-driven initiatives: NFTs, staking concepts, and open dApps powered by DEJI  

---

## 🛡 Phase 4 — Audit & Transparency (Q3 2026)

- Third-party community-funded **security audit**  
- Real-time dashboard for **governance vote tracking**  
- Public reports on proposal history and execution logs  
- Begin **cross-chain exploration** (BSC ↔ Ethereum ↔ Polygon bridges)

---

## 🌎 Phase 5 — Long-Term Vision (Beyond 2026)

- **No central intervention ever** — community governance only  
- Establish **Dejicoin Foundation DAO** (fully on-chain) for grants and ecosystem growth  
- Expand educational, DeFi, and open-source collaborations  
- Solidify Dejicoin as a **symbol of trustless economics and digital freedom**

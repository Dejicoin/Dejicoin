## 🔐 Security Goals

- ✅ **Zero Owner / Admin Control** — Ownership permanently renounced  
- ✅ **Immutable Supply** — No minting or burning functions  
- ✅ **Locked Liquidity** — LP tokens sent to dead address  
- ✅ **Timelock Enforced Governance** — All execution delayed & community-controlled  
- ✅ **Transparent Source Code** — Verified and flattened for public audit

## 🧩 Community Verification

Anyone can verify Dejicoin’s decentralization:

1. Check contract on **BscScan** → Ownership = `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`  
2. Confirm **TimelockController** and **Governor** roles:  
   - `proposerRole` → Governor  
   - `executorRole` → zero address  
   - `adminRole` → none  
3. Review public audit discussions and results in this folder.

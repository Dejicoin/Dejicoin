# Dejicoin (DEJI)

> **Locked Liquidity. Burned Control. True Freedom.**

Dejicoin is a **100% decentralized token** built on **Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20)**.  
No owner. No admin. No manipulation — only **community-driven governance** through immutable smart contracts.

---

## 🔗 Smart Contracts

All Dejicoin logic — **token**, **governance**, and **timelock** — is deployed transparently on the Binance Smart Chain.  
Each contract is verified on BscScan and permanently immutable.

## 🧭 Philosophy

> “In a world controlled by a few, Dejicoin gives power back to everyone.”

Dejicoin isn’t just a token — it’s a **community-owned protocol**.  
No founder privileges. No manual intervention. Only decentralized governance.

## 🛠 Deployment

Deployed **manually via Remix** to ensure verifiable decentralization.  
No private scripts or automated deployment tools — every transaction is public and traceable on-chain.  

See [`docs/deployment_remix.md`](./docs/deployment_remix.md) for full deployment details.

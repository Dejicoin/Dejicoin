Thank you for your interest in contributing to \*\*Dejicoin\*\* —

\## 🧭 Guiding Principles



\- 🕊 \*\*No Centralization:\*\* All contributions must maintain full decentralization — no admin privileges, no ownership transfer.  

\- 🔐 \*\*Security First:\*\* Code must never introduce upgradeable proxies, owner-only modifiers, or hidden control mechanisms.  

\- 🌐 \*\*Transparency:\*\* All code and documentation should be open and verifiable.  

\- 🧱 \*\*Simplicity:\*\* Dejicoin operates on clean, auditable Solidity — no unnecessary dependencies or automation frameworks.

\## ⚙️ Development Environment



We use \*\*Remix IDE\*\* for deployment and testing to keep the system verifiable and fully on-chain.



\### Recommended Tools

\- \*\*Remix IDE:\*\* \[https://remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org)  

\- \*\*Solidity version:\*\* `^0.8.30`  

\- \*\*OpenZeppelin Contracts:\*\* v5.x imports  

\- \*\*Network:\*\* Binance Smart Chain (Testnet / Mainnet)
